# Known issues

Things that are true, annoying, and worth writing down so nobody rediscovers them. Each says what it is, what it costs, and whether anything can be done.

## Script modules have no translation mechanism

**What.** `wp_set_script_translations()` does not work for the Script Modules API, which the Interactivity API is built on. There is no supported way to ship translated strings to an Interactivity store.

**Cost.** Every user-facing string in a store has to be translated in PHP and hydrated through `wp_interactivity_state()`, and TypeScript may never contain a literal a user will read.

**Status.** Core gap, no workaround needed beyond the hydration convention. If core closes it, the hydration is removable — see [interactivity-stores.md](interactivity-stores.md).

## PHPUnit is pinned to 9.6

**What.** The WordPress core test suite requires PHPUnit 9.x. The LAAO theme runs PHPUnit 13 and has no integration suite for exactly this reason; this plugin needs integration tests more than it needs a modern runner.

**Cost.** Newer PHPUnit features are unavailable. `yoast/phpunit-polyfills` covers the assertion API gap.

**Status.** Test-only; no shipped code is affected. Revisit whenever the core test suite supports a newer PHPUnit.
